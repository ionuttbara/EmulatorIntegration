# EmulatorIntegration
Deep Integration for RetroArch in Windows (including extensions, settings and shell association)

# Assosiate the files (emulator) with selected RetroArch Core and File Extensions.
__ATTENTION!__ Some file extensions are .bin so, to prevent the conflict between associations, i'll put custom file associations for roms (scd for Sega CD ROMs for example)
